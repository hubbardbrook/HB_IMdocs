    "text": "8.2 IM role in RAC submissions\nBeginning in Spring 2023, the RAC proposals have been submitted through the Cary institute Jotform. Prior to this, the submission pathway was via website forms hosted at UNH (2008-2014) and google forms (2015-2023). The structure of the form was migrated to JotForm, and from 2023-2024 a number of enhancements have been made. The Hubbard Brook sharepoint RAC folder contains a backup of all proposals. Admin access to the JotForm can be obtained from IT support at the Cary Institute.\nForm related tasks are carried out by the HBR IM (under direction of RAC chair) to include:\n\nDevelopment of a clone of the old website form on the Cary JotForm account\nAdd enhancements as requested by RAC chair\nMonitor incoming proposal\nPrepare proposals for review by RAC (export individually as pdf, and in an appended pdf format).\nHBR IM reaches out to accepted proposal leads to let them know how we archive data in the repository at HBR, what the IM needs to know about their data collection, and what assistance can be provided to them by the IM. See email template\nJotForm technical details in appendices below\nNOTE: Access to all submissions in the JotForm environment can be made available to the RAC chair. In this scenario, there are enhanced features where the proposals could be flagged as ‘under review’, ‘accepted’, etc. And the chair could manage their own downloads of proposals.",
