\[NAME\],

Welcome to the Hubbard Brook Community!

As the Hubbard Brook LTER Information Manager, I'm here to support you throughout your time at our site and to make the process of managing and publishing your data as smooth as possible. As you may already know, we publish our data in the [Environmental Data Initiative Repository (EDI)](https://edirepository.org). You can access HB data by visiting EDI, and also through the data catalog at <https://hubbardbrook.org>. Some quick tips on navigating the repository can be found here (LINK to small slide deck with screen shots).

You have been added to the HB Listserv \[general, grad\], where you will see occasional messages about events and opportunities at Hubbard Brook and the LTER Network. I also recommend signing up for the [LTER Comunity Forum](https://lternet.discourse.group/) where you will get messages of interest direct to your mailbox. On the Forum, you can participate in onging discussions and/or start new threads. It's a great opportunity to interact with others in the network with similar research interests or technical challenges.

If you would like to have a profile page on the Hubbard Brook website, please fill out the items in the list below and I will set that up for you.

Mary
